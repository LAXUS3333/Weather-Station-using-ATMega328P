# Weather-Station-using-ATMega328P
A prototype was made using the ATMega328P chip. It was connected with DHT11 and BMP180 sensors. An LCD screen was added to show the readings of the sensor. A 5V brushless fan was added if the temperature was greater than 25 degree Celcius. The hardware for this was also built.
